# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure of a website or application. It is usually done using simple shapes, boxes, and placeholders to outline where elements like text, images, buttons, and navigation will appear.

## Why Is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing plays a key role in the design process because it allows designers and developers to plan the layout and functionality of a product before adding visual design elements. It helps in:

- Translating ideas into clear, structured layouts  
- Identifying usability issues early  
- Improving communication among team members, clients, and stakeholders  
- Reducing development time by providing a clear blueprint  

Wireframes act as the foundation for the final design and ensure that the user experience is well thought out before moving into high-fidelity design or development.
